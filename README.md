##  Problem Statement
An e-commerce platform needs to sort large volumes of product listings based on different criteria such as **price, ratings, and popularity**. The challenge is to choose the most efficient sorting algorithm that ensures scalability, stability, and performance for millions of entries.

---

##  Implemented Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort** → Simple but inefficient (`O(n²)`), only for very small datasets.  
- **Selection Sort** → Consistent `O(n²)`, minimizes swaps.  
- **Insertion Sort** → Efficient for small or nearly sorted data.  
- **Merge Sort** → Stable, guaranteed `O(n log n)`, requires extra memory.  
- **Quick Sort** → Very fast on average (`O(n log n)`), in-place, but pivot-dependent.  

---

##  Chosen Algorithm
**Merge Sort** was selected for large-scale e-commerce sorting because:  
- It provides **predictable performance** (`O(n log n)`), even with sorted or reverse-sorted data.  
- It is a **stable sort**, preserving relative order (important for multi-level sorting like price + rating).  
- Slight trade-off in memory usage is justified by its **reliability and user experience**.  

 Real-world example: During **Flipkart’s Big Billion Day**, Merge Sort ensures responsiveness while sorting millions of product listings by price.
